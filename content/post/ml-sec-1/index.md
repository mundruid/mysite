Machine Learning (ML) and Cybersecurity: a match made in heaven or yet another tech hype? Both? Indeed, an interesting combination worth exploring for the security professional that wants to solve their problems non traditionally or a data scientist that wants to delve in another cool area. Where do you start? This series of blogs aims to give you a roadmap, tools, inspiration, and technical knowledge to combine these two areas.

This is a blog series that has been inspired by my personal background as a researcher. I enjoy both the ML and Cybersecurity areas and find it difficult to chose one over another. I am passionate about conveying knowledge in an intuitive manner. I would love for this blog series to start stimulationg conversations and set one more little stone to the bridge between the world of the `ML` and `security`.

## Why Cybersecurity & ML?

- examples: malware, network, obervability, other?
- explain figure with intersection
  
## What this blog series is

Below, is a mindmap organizing the topics of this series:

```markmap
- ML & Cybersecurity
  - The basics
    - Dev environment zero to hero
    - But where is all the... data?
    - Let's explore: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
      - Data as a black box
      - The maths
      - The more advanced maths
  - Problem formulation
    - The data way
    - The cyber way
    - A hybrid approach
  - Feature Engineering
    - Quantitative
    - Qualitative
    - Text
    - Extracting features
  - ML Algorithms for Cybersecurity
    - Anomaly Detection
    - Classification
    - Forecasting
```

The prevalent theme in the blogs is the data approach to solving problems in cybersecurity. However, we will be taking this journey from the perspective of the security analyst with examples, concepts, and problems inspired by the field.

## Who is this blog for

The audience for this blog is for the `security researcher` that wants to go beyond intrusion detection systems and solve their problems of detection and prevention with strong data analysis. Curious data scientists may also find these blogs interesting and discover a new area for problem solving.

## What this blog series is not

This is not an online class or a solution to all security problems using ML. It is a comprehensive guide to start and continue getting deeper in both areas.

## Structure of the blog posts

These blog posts will include the following parts:

- Text and code: the main blogs will include text, figures, and working code examples and a reference in github with all code,
- Video: each post will include a video for visual/auditory learners
- References: code, tools, and other resources, such as academic papers and books, will be provided as well so that you can go deeper into the topics.

## Where do we go from here?

I hope you are as excited as I am in starting this journey. First things first though, we need a development environment which we will discuss in the next post.
