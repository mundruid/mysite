summary: Types of testing and their application to Network Automation.
abstract: "
Have you ever written hundreds of lines of Python network automation code only to find out that it does not work as expected? Have you had bugs in your programs that could have been found, if only you had tested for them? In this talk, we will present different types of testing such as unit, system, and integration testing, and how you can integrate these in your current network automation programming workflow. We will introduce mock Python objects that simulate network functions, fixtures, and best practices for comprehensive testing of API requests and network devices. The talk will include coding samples and templates, offering you the tools to start testing your Python code immediately."
