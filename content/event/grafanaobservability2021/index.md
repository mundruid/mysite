summary: Observability for security metrics of smart devices using Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices are ubiquitous, appearing in homes, offices, and public spaces. However, these devices often lack security features due to their fast time to market and insufficient resources for security testing. Network Automation Engineer Xenia Mountrouidou will present a set of novel security metrics based on generic IoT characteristics that relate to security features, and the architecture to collect, visualize, correlate, and alert on them with a Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana (TIG) stack. The goal of this architecture is to make IoT security transparent and measurable. The project, which has a testbed of home assistants, web cameras, smart lights and plugs, and phones, provides insight into how IoT devices are acting while weâ€™re not using them.
